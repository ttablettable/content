# content

## Overview
This repository is the content management system for Table, inspired by Matthias's methods of using Obsidian with a Zettelkasten-based naming convention.

## Structure
- `/drafts`: For stories that are pre-published (Note: This folder is gitignored).
- `/live`: Contains the published versions of stories.
- `/archive`: For the Fameless Quarterly archive.

## Naming Convention
Posts are named using the Zettelkasten method, with each markdown file having a unique timestamp-based identifier for uniqueness and chronological tracking.

## Versioning
Updated versions of posts are created as new files with a new Zettelkasten ID. The original version's ID is referenced in the frontmatter for version history.

## Note
This system is designed for personal use, with the workflow tailored to my content creation and management process.
